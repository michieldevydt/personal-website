        <p class="heading"><strong>Research</strong></p>
        <p>My doctoral research focuses on protest participation. More specifically, I examine the micro-level predictors and outcomes of interpersonal protest recruiting (aka. "asking others" to protest). I mainly use quantitative panel survey data to analyze my research questions. Thematically, I have covered labor union demonstrations, solidarity movements, and the climate movement.</p>
        <p>Together with valued coauthors and excellent promotors, I have published two international descriptive reports on Fridays For Future and one peer-reviewed essay on contemporary climate activism (combined 860+ citations); four other peer-reviewed articles in top-ranking sociology journals (on the topic of interpersonal protest recruiting); and three public reports (on Belgian protests). Two other peer-reviewed publications and one encyclopedia entry are currently under review or forthcoming. Please find my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=SHKQDzYAAAAJ&hl=nl" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I am determined to grow as an empirical social scientist. Political-scientific (3rd one is broader) topics that I believe need empirical attention:
          <li>Does peaceful protest need saving? Even if (the threat of) violence is inherent to protest, we must ask what is driving the current increase in more radical forms of direct action and outright protest violence. Likely it is a response to the advanced routinization (banalization) of protest combined with (a sense of) urgency, but which other factors are driving citizens to (support) non-democratic protest behavior?</li>
          <li>Horizontal affective polarization vs. the ideal of agonistic pluralism: how do we get there?</li>
          <li>Loneliness in times of networked individualism</li>

        <p class="heading"><strong>Data skills</strong></p>
        <p>Using a predominantly quantitative methodological approach, I have gained real experience with data handling and (advanced) analysis (e.g. longitudinal egocentric network data). I consider myself an expert with Qualtrics and Stata, and an ongoing student of Python and R (for data viz). I currently assist academic professionals with various aspects of survey programming, dataset merging and preparation, as well as designing data visualizations.</p>
        <p>I have co-taught classes on multiple regression and scale construction to bachelor students. I keep Feynman in mind when teaching new material to others or myself.</p>
        <p>I take pride in having a solid understanding of the basics in statistics. Please, do ask me about the Central Limit Theorem, degrees of freedom, or what the p-value literally means.</p>

        <p class="heading"><strong>Sub 3'50"</strong></p>
        <p>In the past, I've run decent 800m and 1500m races (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFDTJ0J8JGo" target="_blank">here</a> you can see a younger version of me win a 800m race). Nowadays, 800m is too short & fast for me. However, I am determined to step up my game one more time during the 2024 summer season. My goal is to sharpen my 1500m personal best to a time sub 3'50" (that's 23.5 kph). That would place me in the (circa) top-30 season ranking of Belgian athletes. Training for a sportive goal is a great excercise in building discipline, dealing with inevitable setbacks, and building resilience.</p>
