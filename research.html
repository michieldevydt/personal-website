      <h2>Interpersonal protest recruiting</h2>
      <p>My doctoral research focuses on protest participation. More specifically, I examine the individual-level predictors and outcomes of interpersonal protest recruiting (IPR; a.k.a. "asking others" to protest).</p>
      <p>Why? Because IPR is a key causal driver of protest diffusion and growth. Receiving a recruitment attempt (a.k.a. "being asked") effectively makes — in the causal sense — people more likely to participate (see, e.g., <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.05.005>Lim 2010</a>). Therefore, in order to understand why some protest campaigns grow exponentially whereas others fail to ever attract attention-provoking crowds, part of the answer lies in different IPR patterns (beyond differences at the contextual macro- and meso-level). However, what we know about IPR so far mostly stems from studies that examined IPR indirectly; through the eyes of recruits, not recruiters. My research takes the direct perspective, which allows me to address new questions and collect more precise & valid measurements (I refer to my dissertation for a full discussion on this claim).</p>
      Thematically, I have covered labor union demonstrations, solidarity movements, and the climate movement. I mainly use panel survey data to analyze my research questions.</p>
      <h2>Climate activism</h2>
      <p>In 2019, Fridays For Future and Extinction Rebellion took the world by storm. I have covered these protest movements extensively between late 2018 and 2020, and as of 2024, I have rekindled my interest in climate activism.</p>
      <p>If you are a Belgian journalist looking for research-based commentary on recent developments in climate activism (#FridaysForFuture, Exctinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil), you are very welcome to contact me (please see CV on Homepage for contact info).</p>
      <h2>Research interests</h2>
      <p>Once I have defended my PhD — <em>'tis time to part</em> — I am keen to continue growing as an empirical social scientist, by working on the following (related) topics:</p>
      <li class="list-style">Protest participation</li>
      <li class="list-style">Affective polarization</li>
      <li class="list-style">Non-democratic behavior</li>
      <li class="list-style">Agonistic pluralist model</li>
      <p>The summarized narrative linking these topics goes as follows: protest has become heavily normalized (routinized; predictable). With normalization comes a risk of (perceived) banalization. During recent years, we are  witnessing a return of civil disobedient tactics. However, at the same time, affective polarization tendencies are worsening, with (support for) non-democratic (i.e., violent) protest on the rise. Therefore, I want to examine empirically which factors predict (support for) non-democratic protest, and how (through which channels) we can re-stimulate a culture of positive conflict (i.e., the agonistic model of pluralism). In Belgium, the question of how to return away from affective polarization & towards positive conflict will become extremely relevant in the run-up to the elections (9 June 2024) as well as during the government formation period.</p>
