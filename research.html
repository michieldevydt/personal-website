      <h2>Interpersonal protest recruiting</h2>
      <p>My doctoral research focuses on protest participation. More specifically, I examine the individual-level predictors and outcomes of interpersonal protest recruiting (IPR; a.k.a. "asking others" to protest).</p>
      <p>Why? Because IPR is a key causal driver of protest diffusion and growth. Receiving a recruitment attempt (a.k.a. "being asked") effectively makes — in the causal sense — people more likely to participate (see, e.g., <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.05.005>Lim 2010</a>). Therefore, in order to understand why some protest campaigns grow exponentially whereas others fail to ever attract attention-provoking crowds, part of the answer lies in different IPR patterns (beyond differences at the contextual macro- and meso-level). However, what we know about IPR so far mostly stems from studies that examined IPR indirectly; through the eyes of recruits, not recruiters. My research takes the direct perspective, which allows me to address new questions and collect more precise & valid measurements (I refer to my dissertation for a full discussion on this claim).</p>
      Thematically, I have covered labor union demonstrations, solidarity movements, and the climate movement. I mainly use panel survey data to analyze my research questions.</p>
      <h2>Climate activism</h2>
      <p>In 2019, Fridays For Future and Extinction Rebellion took the world by storm. I have covered these protest movements extensively between late 2018 and 2020, and as of 2024, I have rekindled my interest in climate activism.</p>
      <p>If you are a Belgian journalist looking for research-based commentary on recent developments in climate activism (#FridaysForFuture, Exctinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil), you are very welcome to contact me (please see CV on Homepage for contact info).</p>
      <h2>Research interests</h2>
      <p>Once I have defended my PhD — <em>'tis time to part</em> — I am keen to continue growing as an empirical social scientist, by working on the following (related) topics:</p>
      <li class="list-style">Protest participation</li>
      <li class="list-style">Affective polarization</li>
      <li class="list-style">Non-democratic behavior</li>
      <li class="list-style">Agonistic pluralist model</li>
      <p>The summarized narrative linking these topics goes as follows: protest has become heavily normalized (routinized; predictable). With normalization comes a risk of (perceived) banalization. As a response to the normalization of lawful street protests, activists are increasingly turning to civil disobedient tactics.</p>
      <p>We witnessed this most clearly in the domain of climate activism: whereas Fridays For Future popularized school truancy as a mild form of non-violent civil disobedience, other climate protest campaigns (e.g., Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil) employ more disrupting forms of civil disobedience. These groups seek to disrupt public life in order to more forcefully draw attention to their concerns. In short, contemporary protest groups are (re-)introducing new or under-used tactics to their action repertoire.</p>
      <p>However, this begs the question whether the current expansion—lawful street demonstrations remain popular—towards civil disobedient behaviours is effectively also paving the way towards outright violent tactics, such as destructive sabotage and rioting.</p>
      <p>This question becomes extra pressing when we consider that many democracies are faced with worsening trends in affective polarization. Affective polarization refers to the phenomenon where individuals' feelings and emotions towards members of their own political party or group become more positive, while their feelings towards members of the opposing party or group become more negative. While conflict (in- vs. out-group think) is essential to politics, democracy is at risk when citizens are no longer able to respectfully disagree ideologically with other-minded citizens (horizontal polarization) and politicians (vertical polarization) but increasingly hate the out-group. The storming of the US Capital on Jan 6, 2020 serves as a sad highlight so far.</p>
      <p>With worsening affective polarization tendencies and a protest culture that is increasingly using civil disobedient tactics, we must address the real and pressing question of how protest can keep its ‘teeth’ without feeling the need to resort to outright violence. Key questions are:
      <li class="list-style">Which factors predict (support for) violent protest behaviour?</li>
      <li class="list-style">When do protesters feel heard and effective?</li>
      <li class="list-style">How can protest organizers and police continue to co-manage their protests without provoking escalation?</li>
      <li class="list-style">How can we stimulate a culture of positive conflict (i.e., the agonistic model of pluralism)</li></p>
      <p>In Belgium, the question of how to prevent widespread affective polarization & how to move towards positive conflict will become extremely relevant in the run-up to the elections (9 June 2024) as well as during the government formation period.</p>
